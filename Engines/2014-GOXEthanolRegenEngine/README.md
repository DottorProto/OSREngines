# 2014 - GOX Ethanol Regen Engine 

## Description
My first attempt at producing a working regenerative 3D printed rocket engine. The engine is designed to run off GOX/Ethanol at 150psia and generate 50lbf of thrust. Unfortunately, producing this much thrust proved difficult as I could not generate enough GOX mass flow to achieve this thrust level. Also, the regenerative channels did not print correctly (this is a challenge with SLS printing), however, the engine did successfully fired. I learned a lot from the experience and plan to use this experience to improve for future designs.

The engine is meant to mate with:
* [This injector](../../Injectors/2014-GOXEthanolInjector)
* [This igniter](../../Igniters/2014-GOXEthanolTest)

## Build Instructions
This is an STL only. Unfortunately, I do not have the underlying files

## Resources
* A copy of the model can be found on [Shapeways](http://shpws.me/EGlh)
* Information about the igniter and testing can be found on the FUBAR labs Wiki [here](http://wiki.fubarlabs.org/fubarwiki/3D-Printed-Engine.ashx)
