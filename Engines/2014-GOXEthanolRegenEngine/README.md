# 2014 - GOX Ethanol Regen Engine 

## Description
My first attempt at producing a working regenerative 3D printed engine. Unfortunately, the regenerative channels did not print correctly (this is a challenge with SLS printing), however, the engine successfully fired. I learned a lot from the experience and plan to use this experience to improve for future designs.

## Build Instructions
This is an STL only. Unfortunately, I do not have the underlying files

## Resources
* A copy of the model can be found on [Shapeways](http://shpws.me/EGlh)
