# 2014 - GOX Ethanol Test Igniter

## Description
My first attempt at 3D printing a spark igniter. The igniter is designed to run off GOX/Ethanol at 100psia and produce 2.5 lbf of thrust. The igniter has many ports to in order to find the optimal orifice designs and work out some issues with my earlier traditionally machined igniters.

Since this igniter is mainly meant for my own testing purposes it is probably not very useful in general projects as I will be producing more refined versions of this design based on the lessons I've learned from testing this one. However, feel free to use it in your projects.

## Build Instructions
This is an STL only. Unfortunately, I do not have the underlying files
