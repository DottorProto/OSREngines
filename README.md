Open Source Rocket Engines

## What is this??
This Git Repository contains CAD design files for open source liquid fueled rocket engines that I like to build. More information regarding the project can be found on the FUBAR labs wiki [here](http://wiki.fubarlabs.org/fubarwiki/Small-Liquid-Fueled-Rocket-Engines.ashx).

## What can I do with this??
You can do whatever you like with these files provided it complies with the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License. For example, if you are interested in building your own engine it may be helpful to view this to see what others have built first so that you aren't starting 100% from scratch. Or you may wish to make or suggest improvements to these models.

## Repository Structure??
This repository has the following structure:
* Igniters
* Injectors
* Engines
Each folder in the above directories is a self-contained unit containing stl files, design files/analysis, and other supporting materials. The contents of each folder may vary so check each one individually for details. 

In many cases components are meant to mate with each other. For example, an engine may mate with a specific injector and igniter. In these instances pointers to the additional components are referenced. So if you are interested in testing an engine that goes with a specific injector you could either download the corresponding injector or modify the engine to mate with a diffierent injector. All design files contain details of port-fitting, etc... so it should be relatively straightforward to connect these components.
