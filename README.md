Open Source Rocket Engines

## What is this??
This Git Repository contains CAD design files for open source liquid fueled rocket engines that I like to build. More information regarding the project can be found on the FUBAR labs wiki [here](http://wiki.fubarlabs.org/fubarwiki/Small-Liquid-Fueled-Rocket-Engines.ashx). 

## What can I do with this??
You can do whatever you like with these files provided it complies with the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License. For example, if you are interested in building your own engine it may be helpful to view this to see what others have built first so that you aren't starting 100% from scratch. Or you may wish to make or suggest improvements to these models.

## Repository Structure??
This repository has the following structure:
* Each folder in the below directories is a self-contained unit containing stl files, design files/analysis, and other supporting material. The contents of each folder may vary so check each one individually for details
  * Igniters
  * Injectors
  * Engines
* Each folder in the directory **combined** contains multiple objects. For example, If an igniter, injector, and engine are meant to be used together a copy of all 3 files will be saved here with pointers to the underlying components.
